@ This program was made to approximate sin(x) by using a taylorSeries equation
@ R0 = Not used
@ R1 = Taylor series number (3, 5, 7)
@ R2 = Sign bit (controls whether we subtract or add)
@ R3 = Our factorial
@ R4 = Our taylor series precision (how many times we repeat the series)

	MOV R7,LR @ Load our link register into R7 for later branching back to prog8.s
	MOV R1,#3 @ Load our first taylor series number into R1
	MOV R6,R1 @ Copy our first taylor series number into R6
	MOV R2,#1 @ Our sign bit -1 is negative 1 is positive (duh)
	MOV R4,#3 @ Our taylor series precision
	MOV R5,#-1 @ Negative one to change our sign bit
	@LDR R0,=radVal
	@VLDR S0,[R0]
	VMOV S3,S0 @ Copy our original radian value into S3 for manipulation
